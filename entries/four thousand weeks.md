We live our lives week by week. A week feels frustratingly limited and there are
alarmingly few of them. Assuming you live to eighty, you'll have had about four
thousand weeks.

Reflecting on the books I read last year,
[four thousand weeks](https://amzn.to/3GnJlR9) by Oliver Burkeman stuck with me
the most. While pitched as yet another productivity management book, it's
something of a bait-and-switch tricking you into reading about philosophy. In
particular directly acknowledging our own mortality and in fact pushing back on
the idea of optimizing yourself to accomplish more.

I liked this book so much that I decided to build something of a
[digital book report](https://leebyron.com/4000/). It contains some of the most
salient excerpts, quotes, and themes quotes from the book. I hope you enjoy it
and does a small part in helping you make the most of your own finitude.
