As I write this it's performance reviews season at my company, which means new
interest and focus on the expectations of engineers of each _level_. My role is
to help define this for our front-end engineers and ensure fair outcomes. A
common question I hear throughout this process is: _what is a staff engineer?_

My company, like many in the tech industry defines a progression of [levels] for
engineers, setting expectations for each. Others may use a set of titles, these
are often interchangeable. To grossly simplify

| Level                  | Scope                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| New Grad               | The first few years after joining the industry. Expected to learn quickly, complete tasks and small projects assigned with little guidance, and continue to learn and develop. |
| Junior Eng             | Typically 2-6 years after joining the industry. Completes moderate projects with autonomy and contributes to the team in other ways.                                           |
| Senior Eng             | Typically 5 or more years of experience. Accountable for large projects requiring multiple teammates and external stakeholders. Mentors and improves their team.               |
| Staff Eng[^and-beyond] | Typically 10 or more years of experience. Peer to managers, accountable for their team's roadmap and technical vision. Then... things get complicated.                         |

[^and-beyond]:
    Some companies define titles beyond Staff Eng, like "Senior Staff Eng",
    "Principle Eng", "Distinguished Eng", or "Technical Fellow". What I share
    here is also true for these engineers, just further into the limit.

Most companies provide expectations guidelines alongside these levels, often
breaking things down by technical skills, soft skills, leadership, etc. These
can be helpful tools for both engineers and managers to guide them in their
career, but I've found this often breaks down at the Staff Eng level, for a few
reasons:

- There just aren't that many Staff+ Eng to compare and generalize. Most
  organizations will have less than 1 in 12 engineers at this level.

- Every one of these engineers is a different person, who found a unique impact
  relative to what was needed and what they're good at. No two Staff+ Eng follow
  exactly the same path.

- The gamut of potential impact is so diverse that what is central to one Staff
  Engineer's impact may be near absent from another. It can be hard to even
  define base expectations.

A different approach is necessary. Rather than define one set of expectations
for Staff Eng, describe [Staff Eng Archetypes] (one of many fantastic resources
from [staffeng.com](https://staffeng.com/)). Archetypes, or Personas, is a
concept borrowed from literature, psychology and UX design, with the goal to
simultaneously describe the diversity of the role by breaking it into different
smaller groups, while also generalizing within each group. The staffeng.com
article describes four of these Staff Eng archetypes:

- The _Tech Lead_ guides the technical execution of a particular team via day to
  day leadership. The most common Staff Eng archetype, and a natural extension
  of the expectations of a Senior Eng. This is such a common path to management,
  that there's a common term "TLM" for the variant of a Tech Lead which also
  takes on some people management responsibility, furthering their autonomy.
- The _Architect_ sets the vision for a domain, and are accountable for its
  success, often requiring many teams working together. This may be a purely
  technical vision or a product vision.
- The _Solver_ goes deep to solve problems no one else can. Not purely
  technical, really tough problems are often equal part organizational and
  require good communication skill and "bedside manner".
- The _Right Hand_ extends a leader's bandwidth by helping operate a complex
  organization, converting inefficiencies into well run programs, and bounce
  between whatever is most urgent, be it tech, people, process, or business.

If these all sound really different from each other, that's the idea! There are
just as many ways to becoming a Staff Eng as there are engineers with that
title. I love that these four archetypes each highlight a very different core
competency: tactical leadership, vision setting, technical excellence, and
organized execution. It wouldn't be possible to define base expectations across
these for all Staff Eng.

I also appreciate that using archetypes is still flawed. Not everyone will fit
into these four buckets, some may bridge between multiple, others will define
their own path. For those with aspirations to become a Staff Eng and those that
manage them, the most important advise is to not emulate others but find and
lean into your own strengths.
