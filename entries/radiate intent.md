> It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission.\
> — Grace Hopper[^1]

[^1]:
    This advice as quoted was popularized by all around badass Grace Hopper.
    However various forms
    [have been cited](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/06/19/forgive/), back
    as far as St. Benedict in 500 AD. Likely some form of it has existed as long
    as there has been organized human society.

This is classic advice when operating in a large organization. You see a problem
to be solved, have a bold solution in mind, and have everything necessary to
take action, but there will be very real costs felt broadly. You think the
tradeoff is worth it, but will your higher-ups agree? Or will they simply blame
you for the costs without appreciating the problem solved?

You likely have the best information on the decision but might assume you need
permission to incur the costs. If your higher-ups assume the same then analysis
paralysis sets in. If it's a good idea, _go ahead and do it_. Grace Hopper
encouraged a bias to action; to do the right thing for the org whether or not
they know it to be. If you're wrong or get flak for the costs: ask forgiveness;
you acted in good faith.

This good advice is missing one critical thing: _radiating intent_.

While "forgiveness, not permission" considers what you're asking, it says
nothing about what you're telling. If you anticipate needing to ask forgiveness
after taking action then its best to get ahead of it by explaining the decision
clearly immediately after you've made it. Even better, explain _before_ you act
then radiate it: share far and wide.

With this in mind it becomes clear that rather than shifting from asking before
to after you act, you should instead shift from asking to telling. Don't seek
permission, seek to inform. Radiating intent is telling what you will do before
you do it.

Elizabeth Ayer, in her
[excellent article](https://medium.com/@ElizAyer/dont-ask-forgiveness-radiate-intent-d36fd22393a3)
on radiating intent explains why it's a superior approach (which I've
editorialized):

- Invites participation from those with critical info or desire to help
- If you're wrong, it gives a chance for someone to stop you _before hand_
- Leaves evidence of good faith. Better to be known as predictable than
  underhanded.
- You keep responsibility and own the outcome, good or bad. Doesn’t transfer
  blame as seeking permission does.
- Sets the example that bold action is encouraged from everyone, not just
  organizational higher-ups.

If it's a good idea, go ahead and do it. Say loudly what you are doing along the
way. _Radiate intent!_
