        <a href="../">til</a><span>leap®</span>
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_Cat" target="_blank">Canon Cat</a> was a computer designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin" target="_blank">Jef Raskin</a>, who also dreamed up the
Apple Macintosh. Steve Jobs meddled too much in the Mac and Raskin left Apple to
create the Cat<a href="#fn-swyft" id="fn-swyft.ref" data-footnote-ref aria-label="note"><sup>1</sup></a>. It was a commercial flop, but had some awesome ideas
mostly lost to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Raskin was no fan of the computer mouse and thought keyboard driven UIs could be
much more powerful, and the Cat has a couple tricks which show that he was truly
onto something, most notably: <em>Leap</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cat keyboard is really unique. This computer has no mouse and no arrow
keys<a href="#fn-creep" id="fn-creep.ref" data-footnote-ref aria-label="note"><sup>2</sup></a>. Instead it has &quot;Leap&quot; keys under the space bar.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="../media/32fbd2a67421bb0d.jpeg">
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            To move around you hold down a Leap key with your thumb (in the direction you
want to move) and start typing the thing you want to move to. The cursor moves
in real-time with each key press.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If you got it wrong you can hit &quot;Undo&quot; to go back.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            To keep looking for the same thing, hold &quot;Use Front&quot;<a href="#fn-use-front" id="fn-use-front.ref" data-footnote-ref aria-label="note"><sup>3</sup></a> and &quot;Leap
Again&quot;.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            There's a dedicated &quot;Page&quot; button so you can Leap through page by page to
rapidly move through a large file (or press it on its own to create a new
blank page).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Pressing both Leap keys highlights the text between the cursor and the
previously leapt location. Leaping with highlighted text moves that text along
with the cursor.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is so different from what we're used to that it seems like it might be
frustrating to use and rightfully part of history instead of current kit, but I
find this inspiring. I wish I could get my computer to work this way!
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been using VIM exclusively the last few weeks and trying to get used to it.
I'm realizing that I spend way more time <em>moving around</em> then I actually do
typing new things. I've come to really appreciate the <code>/</code> and <code>?</code> commands which
search ahead and back for some text to move towards. It's very powerful, but
slightly awkward to use, so I find myself not using it as much as I should.
Having that functionality under my thumbs would feel like a super power.
      </p>
      <p>
        There aren't that many Canon Cats still floating around, but if you want to get
a feel for what using one of these is like, you can run its
<a href="https://archive.org/details/canoncat" target="_blank">software in emulation mode</a> thanks to the
Internet Archive! How to use this is not very clear, but here's what I figured
out so far:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            option keys (left and right) are Jump
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <code>\</code> key is Undo
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            control is &quot;Use Front&quot;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Full screen the emulator to immerse yourself!
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Obviously, it's not quite the same as having the Cat keyboard in front of you,
but I still found it very curious to use and gave me confidence that this could
be an easily learned and very fun to use digital world to live in.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are surprisingly almost no modern tools that reference back to Leap and
the Canon Cat. One notable one is the <a href="https://100r.co/site/left.html" target="_blank">Left</a> text editor by 100 Rabbits, which
very recently
<a href="https://twitter.com/hundredrabbits/status/1466832328462790656?s=21" target="_blank">added Leap</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some resources with a lot more content, digitized instruction manuals,
history, and other bits and bobs down this particular rabbit hole:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <a href="http://www.canoncat.net/" target="_blank">canoncat.net</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.canoncat.org/" target="_blank">canoncat.org</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=642" target="_blank">Canon Cat on old-computers.com</a>
          </p>
        </li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Finally, I'll leave you with this convincing promotional video showing off the
Cat in use, showing both more of what it can do<a href="#fn-calc" id="fn-calc.ref" data-footnote-ref aria-label="note"><sup>4</sup></a> as well as some truly
excellent '80s hairstyles.

              Jef Raskin started the project by founding a company, Information
Appliances, and called the computer SWYFT: &quot;Superb With Your Favorite
Typing&quot;. Canon acquired his company and their marketing team came up with
the name &quot;Cat.&quot; No idea if Apple intentionally took a pot-shot at Jef with
Swift.
            </p>

          <li id="fn-creep">
            <p>
              Arrow behavior is kinda still there. Tapping Leap on its own moves the
cursor ahead by one. they fittingly called this &quot;Creep&quot;. Shift+Leap would
scroll the page up and down.
            </p>
            <a href="#fn-creep.ref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="return">↩</a>

          <li id="fn-use-front">
            <p>
              The &quot;Use Front&quot; key is essentially your &quot;Command&quot; key, but they
printed the commands on the front of the key caps, hence &quot;Use Front&quot;.
            </p>
            <a href="#fn-use-front.ref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="return">↩</a>

          <li id="fn-calc">
            <p>
              Like running calculations (or code!) live in a document with a key press
instead of having a dedicated calc app. Really cool ideas.
