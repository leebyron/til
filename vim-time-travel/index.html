        To undo and redo in Vim, use <code>u</code> and <code>⌃⇧R</code> (“CTRL-R” in Vim lingo, note the capital R) respectively. This works as you’d expect, but there are a few shortcomings:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            It is very easy to undo, but dexterously challenging to redo.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If you undo, then accidentally make an edit, you can’t redo.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Fortunately Vim has a very powerful undo feature called “undo trees” which you might understand as similar to git branching. Undoing and then starting a new change is just a separate branch in the undo tree. There are a number of ways of interacting with the undo tree<a href="#fn:undo-redo" id="fn:undo-redo.ref" data-footnote-ref aria-label="note"><sup>1</sup></a>, but a comparatively simple one is undo time travel.
      </p>
      <p>
        To go to an earlier state, use <code>g-</code>, to go to a later state, <code>g+</code>. If you mess up with undo and redo, you can usually just try <code>g-</code> repeatedly until you’re back where you want to be. While this is not quite as easy to remember as <code>u</code> for undo, I find “go earlier” and “go later” as pretty great mnemonics and really appreciate the symmetry.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are shorthand for the <code>:earlier</code> and <code>:later</code> commands, which are quite flexible. As an example, <code>:earlier 5m</code> will go to whatever version you were looking at five minutes ago. Amazing.

        <ol>
          <li id="fn:undo-redo">
            <p>
              Another example of interacting with the undo tree is <code>:undolist</code>, which shows all leafs in the tree. To learn more about undo, try <code>:help undo-redo</code>.
