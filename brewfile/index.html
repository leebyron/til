        I’m a huge fan of <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">brew</a>. I use it for installing a broad list of command line tools, as well as Mac apps. Most apps you use can be installed with <code>brew install --cask</code>. However, where I’ve found Brew most helpful is as a lightweight way to set up new computers with all the apps and utilities I rely on. To do this, I use <em>Brewfile</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is brew’s equivalent of a package.json or Gemfile, it’s just a list of all software that should be installed. To get started quickly run <code>brew bundle</code> and to learn more, see the <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle" target="_blank">Homebrew/homebrew-bundle</a> repo.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, keeping the Brewfile up to date as new things are installed does not happen automatically. Here are a few additional things I do:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            I keep my <code>.Brewfile</code> in my homedir, and track it as part of my <a href="https://github.com/leebyron/dotfiles" target="_blank">dotfiles</a>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I use <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-aliases" target="_blank"><code>brew alias</code></a> to keep commonly used commands and their arguments terse. The most important being <code>brew add</code> which is a replacement for <code>brew install</code> which also updates the Brewfile, <code>brew remove</code> replacing <code>brew uninstall</code> and <code>brew sync</code> which installs anything new after pulling dotfiles changes from another machine. You can see all of <a href="https://github.com/leebyron/dotfiles/tree/main/.brew-aliases" target="_blank">these scripts</a> which I also include in my dotfiles repo.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The final result is that setting up a new machine with a list of apps I use is pretty easy, as is keeping that install base the same across a few computers I use. Brew alias makes it easy to keep everything correct.
      </p>
      <p>
        For personal machines, this has been much more simple and useable than Vagrant, Ansible, or other more professional environment management tool.
