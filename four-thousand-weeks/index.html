      <p>
        We live our lives week by week. A week feels frustratingly limited and there are alarmingly few of them. Assuming you live to eighty, you’ll have had about four thousand weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reflecting on the books I read last year, <a href="https://amzn.to/3GnJlR9" target="_blank">four thousand weeks</a> by Oliver Burkeman stuck with me the most. While pitched as yet another productivity management book, it’s something of a bait-and-switch tricking you into reading about philosophy. In particular directly acknowledging our own mortality and in fact pushing back on the idea of optimizing yourself to accomplish more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I liked this book so much that I decided to build something of a <a href="https://leebyron.com/4000/" target="_blank">digital book report</a>. It contains some of the most salient excerpts, quotes, and themes quotes from the book. I hope you enjoy it and does a small part in helping you make the most of your own finitude.
