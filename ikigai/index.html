      <p>
        Years ago I came across the concept of &quot;Ikigai&quot; (or &quot;life's reason&quot;) in <a href="https://theviewinside.me/what-is-your-ikigai/" target="_blank">a blog
post</a>, along with an explanatory four-axis venn
diagram<a href="#fn-meme-seeding" id="fn-meme-seeding.ref" data-footnote-ref aria-label="note"><sup>1</sup></a>. It introduced the concept of honing in on a life's
purpose by way of doing what you're good at, what you enjoy, what the world
needs, and what you can be paid for. This really resonated with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find this model a helpful tool in thinking about my own career, but it's
important to remember that it's just that: a model. While I like the framework,
as I've read more about Ikigai I also have some real concerns with it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            It's mired in the pseudo-science of &quot;self help&quot; that I'm really suspicious of.
Most books frame Ikigai as an elusive thing to start searching for today, that
you need to find happiness, and need coaching to achieve.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            It feels like yet another foreign cultural fetishization. Ikigai is a Japanese
concept but nearly all material written on it is English.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The origins of Ikigai's introduction to English readers is via a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_buettner_how_to_live_to_be_100" target="_blank">TED
talk</a> on the unusual lives of centenarians in
Okinawa, Japan which don't seem to relate to the venn diagram; where did that
come from?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These concerns turn out to be valid. In fact the origin of this venn diagram
concept is not Japanese at all, but instead comes from a book by Spanish
Astrologist, Andrés Zuzunaga. <a href="https://theviewinside.me/what-is-your-ikigai/" target="_blank">Marc Winn's blog post</a> combined <a href="https://www.cosmograma.com/proposito.php" target="_blank">Andrés
Zuzunaga's original graphic</a> with the idea of Ikigai presented in <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_buettner_how_to_live_to_be_100" target="_blank">Dan
Buettner's TED talk</a> and voilà, a meme!
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite it's shortcomings and misappropriation I still really like this mental
model for considering career progression and debugging gaps in a sense of
fulfillment. Here's my translation of <a href="https://www.cosmograma.com/proposito.php" target="_blank">Andrés Zuzunaga's original graphic</a> in
English:

        Ikigai is still a very real concept, just not the same one as presented by most
of these blog posts and books. Japanese neuroscientist Ken Mogi (who has also
written a book on Ikigai) has <a href="https://youtu.be/a_2RIydy_NQ" target="_blank">a video</a> addressing this venn
diagram with an attempt to bring the term back to an original intent. In the
video he proposes a new (crude, hand-drawn) diagram to take its place with two
distinct changes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The four circles of the venn diagram are replaced with two axis: small to big
and private to public.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Rather than Ikigai being found at the center of this diagram, he emphatically
repeats that <em>all of it</em> is Ikigai.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goal being not to find the one perfect thing which checks all boxes but
instead to cultivate a broad diversity of things big and small, public and
private, to bring a rich multifaceted purpose to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also appreciate this very different model, and took the liberty to capture
Ken's &quot;true Ikigai diagram&quot; with a few additions in a similar spirit:

        <ol>
          <li id="fn-meme-seeding">
            <p>
              Years later, Marc wrote a <a href="https://theviewinside.me/meme-seeding/" target="_blank">follow up
post</a> on the origins of his article on Ikigai and
addressed how it took on a life of its own.
